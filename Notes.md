**Scope of B2B,B2C and businesss processes**
- Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce is greater than business-to-customer (B2C) e-commerce because it require more no of orders.
Ex,Whole buys it's product in bulk to retailers.But retailers could able sell only a subset of product they received from wholesaler.
- Business procesess has larger scope than B2C and B2B combined, because they support both wholesalers and retailers.

**Network Infrastructure**
- Main goal here is to connect computers through internet.
- Today, the network infrastructure, known as internet, consists of heterogeneous transport 
systems(like fiber optics, satellite, and wireless networks). In internet data differents computers interconnect and transfer data using 
standards called TCP/IP. TCP/IP is concerned with the issue of providing a reliable data 
transmission mechanism for applications. All the computers connected/accessible on the 
internet share a common name and address space. The standard prevalent addressing 
scheme uses 32-bit numbers called IP addresses, to uniquely identify the machine.
- The construction of a reliable network infrastructure requires two types of hardware—
transmission media and components such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges. 
-  The 
network bandwidth is usually dependent upon the quality of transmission media. The 
coaxial  cables,  copper  wire,  fiber  optical  cables,  radio,  microwave,  and  satellite  based  
transmission mechanisms are some modes utilized for the physical transmission of data.

**Information distribution technology**
- Main goal is to provide transmission mechanism to transmit content/info over network
- It is accomplished 
through software systems that implement File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol (HTTP), and Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for exchanging multimedia 
contents  consisting  of  text,  graphics,  video,  and  audio  data. 

**Network multimedia content(Ecom2,pg no -110)**
- The  information  distribution  protocol,  HTTP,  delivers  the  documents  written  in  the 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), to the client program. 
- **HTML:** The language offers an easy 
way for integrating multimedia content in a document form and the integrated content then can be published using the HTTP servers. 
- Clients can access this by entering URL address which is unique and specific to each document website.

**Security and Encryption**
-  the two important issues need to be addressed: protection 
of the source of information that is being made available online, and protection of the 
transaction that travels over the network. 
- The  first  issue  is  addressed  by  deploying  strong  site  security  measures  that  
constantly monitor authentication, virus detection,firewalls,etc.
- The second issue of securing the transaction, carried out over the network, requires 
addressing  several  security  and  privacy  related  issues. 
- The privacy  of  the  transaction  data  can  be  addressed  by  using  various  encryption 
techniques(refer notebook)

**Business service infrastructure**
- Business service infrastructure is all about finding companies that can provide specific services(marketing,manufacturing,heatlcare) or products to meet business needs.
- They use for directories and catalogues for listing the dealers.


- protocols(pg 64,Ecom1)

**Protocols**
---
1. **TCP/IP**
- TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) converts the messages into packets so the that it that it can transfer from one network to the other.
- Before reaching the receiver these packets are converted to their original format.
- IP(Internet Protocol) specifies the IP addres of the receiver before converting them to packets.

2. **Email**
- It uses a client server architecture.
- Each organisation has a email server that handles emails

3. **SMTP/POP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol/Post Office Protocol)**
- protcols for sending and retriving messages
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) specifies the format of a mail message and
describes how mail is to be managed on the e-mail server and transmitted on the
Internet.
- POP (Post Office Protocol) is a protocol that allows an email client to retrieve messages from an email server, with options to download and delete or keep the messages on the server.

**Web Server(357,Ecom1)**

<img src="Images/Screenshot 2024-10-06 205834.png" width="" height="">

- When the server receives the request message, it executes the command included in the
message (in this case, it sends a particular Web page file back to the client). The server does
this by retrieving the Web page file from its disk (or another disk on a network to which it
is connected) and then creating a properly formatted response message to send back to the
client.
- A server’s response consists of three parts that are identical in structure to a request
message: a response header line, one or more response header fields, and an optional entity
body.

**Ecommerce Software(Ecom1,pg no 399)**
- The basic features of ecommerce software include:
1. **Catalog display**
- A catalogue is a listing of goods and services.
- It organizes the goods and services being sold.
- A **static catalog** is a simple list written in HTML that appears on a Web
page or a series of Web pages.
- To add an item, delete an item, or change an item’s listing, the
company must edit the HTML of one or more pages. Larger commerce sites are more likely
to use a dynamic catalog. 
- A **dynamic catalog** stores the information about items in a database, usually on a separate computer that is accessible to the server that is running the Website itself. 
- A dynamic catalog can feature multiple photos of each item, detailed descriptions,
and a search tool that allows customers to search for an item and determine its availability.
- It is useful for giving real time updates.

2. **Shopping Cart**
- A shopping cart in e-commerce software is a digital tool that allows customers to select, store, and manage products they intend to purchase before completing the transaction at checkout.
- Earlier, it is used to be static now it is dynamic.

3. **Transaction processing**
- Transaction processing occurs when the shopper proceeds to the virtual checkout counter
by clicking a checkout button.
- **Checkout** refers to the process where customers finalize their purchase by reviewing their selected items, entering payment and shipping information, and confirming the transaction to complete the order. 
- Then the ecommerce software performs any
necessary calculations, such as volume discounts, sales tax, and shipping cost.

**Security threats to computer(ecom1,pg no-440)**
- An eavesdropper is someone who secretly listens to or intercepts data being transmitted over a network without altering it.

**Intellectual property threats(ecom1,pgno 319)**
- **intellectual property (IP)** refers to the legal rights that protect creator.

- Eg;An example of intellectual property is the patent for a new invention, such as a smartphone camera technology that enhances image quality. This patent gives the inventor exclusive rights to manufacture and sell that technology for a certain period, preventing others from using or reproducing it without permission.
- **example of cybersquatter**, if someone registers a domain name like examplebrand.com to sell it to the legitimate owner of the Example Brand trademark, that person would be considered a cyber squatter.
- One example of **name changing** as a threat to intellectual property (IP) is when a company undergoes a rebranding and changes its name to a similar-sounding name that closely resembles an existing trademark, potentially leading to consumer confusion.
- If a beverage company named "FreshFizz" rebrands to "FreshFizzX"—a name that closely resembles an established brand like "FreshBreeze"—this could pose a threat to the original brand's trademark rights. Consumers might mistakenly believe that the two brands are related or that the new brand is an extension of the original, potentially diluting the original brand's reputation and causing financial harm. This kind of name change can lead to legal disputes over trademark infringement and consumer confusion, threatening the original brand's intellectual property rights.
- One example of **name stealing** as a threat to intellectual property (IP) is when a new business registers a trademark that is identical or very similar to an existing well-known brand, intending to benefit from that brand's reputation.
- If a company called "Apple Tech" starts selling electronics and registers the trademark "Apple" for its products, it could cause confusion among consumers who associate the name "Apple" with the established technology giant Apple Inc. This situation threatens Apple Inc.'s IP rights by diluting its brand identity, potentially misleading consumers, and infringing on the existing trademark. If consumers mistakenly believe that "Apple Tech" is affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc., it undermines the original brand's reputation and can lead to legal action for trademark infringement.

**Active Content**
- Active content refers to web-based elements or scripts that can execute or run on a user's computer, enabling dynamic interactions and functionalities within a webpage.
- Unlike static content, which remains unchanged until a page reload, active content can respond to user actions or events in real time.
-   Active content is used in electronic commerce to place items into a
shopping cart and compute a total invoice amount, including sales tax, handling, and shipping costs.
- Active content enhances user experience by making web pages more interactive and engaging. However, it also raises security concerns, as malicious active content can potentially exploit vulnerabilities on a user's computer.

**Cookies**
- A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's computer by a web browser while browsing a website.

**Web Bug**
- A web bug (also known as a tracking pixel or web beacon) is a tiny, often invisible image or script embedded in a web page or email, used to monitor user behavior. It is typically a 1x1 pixel graphic
- Web bugs are used for analytics, advertising, and user tracking, but they can also raise privacy concerns because they can monitor user actions without the user's explicit knowledge.
